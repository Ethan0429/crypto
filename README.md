# crypto
Unix system file encryption/decryption program written in C/C++
## Compile Instructions:
In shell w/GCC: `$ g++ -std=c++11 crypto.cpp`

Works on Linux distributions and MacOS

## Background:
I mostly built this program on a whim to see if I understood basic cryptography. Turns out I did! It's mostly built programmed in C, but I am using a few C++ features like lambdas, auto keywords, range-based loops, and the vector library.
